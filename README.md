Endless Dungeon  
Created by Scott Kim  

images/sounds: game images and sounds folder
  -dungeon.html: dungeon window: Background is inside the dungeon; stage number, enemy health bar, enemy portrait... etc.  
                                 enemy portrait is brought by using the Robohash.org hash algorithm.
  -gameCSS.css: game style sheet. Should/could have created multiple sheets for different windows.  
  -gameJS.js: game js file. The same as the stylesheet.  
  -main.html: the main html file that displays the 2 iwindows of menu and dungeon, as well as shop and help window.  
  -menu.html: the menu window: Attack button; players stats; submenus like pause, shop, and help buttons.  


The most difficult and time consuming thing, believe or not, was planning the basic game design/layout.  
I wanted to plan out something that is possible to achieve within my skill, but again that is somewhat challenging  
that I could/need to research and learn more. If I stick with something that I already know, where is the fun in that?  

Another thing that took me a long time as well was dynamically adjustable layout.  
I feel like that I've spent way too much time on the basic layout than the actual game program/algorithm,  
yet it's still not 100% of what I have envisioned.

One thing that I've learnt is that people are attracted and appreciative a lot more on the visuals and the sounds.  
When there were no monster portraits and no sound effects,(maybe no icons either) my girlfriend was jokingly telling me  
"what happend to all your hours and hours of work? Is that all?"  
However, once I've added some sound effects and a bit of more images, of which didn't take that much time and effort  
compared to the other things, she was rather impressed.  

Overall, it was a fun project and I wish and will work more onto it.  

All the images and sounds are from the free sources, and I tried my best to link them within the codes.  
I especially thank the robohash.org. It is a very interesting website  

TODO: shop menu  
      maybe bug fix? (didn't have time to check out bugs)
